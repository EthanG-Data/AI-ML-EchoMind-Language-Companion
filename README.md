*EchoMind analyzing sentiment and generating an empathetic response*

##  Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/echomind-sentiment-ai.git
   cd echomind-sentiment-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run App.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`
   - If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to the URL shown in your terminal

##  Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with these dependencies:

```txt
streamlit>=1.28.0
transformers>=4.30.0
torch>=2.0.0
langdetect>=1.0.9
sentencepiece>=0.1.99
```

##  How It Works

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
EchoMind uses the **CardiffNLP Twitter RoBERTa** model to analyze the emotional content of your input:
- **Positive**: Optimistic, happy, encouraging content
- **Neutral**: Balanced, factual, objective content  
- **Negative**: Concerned, sad, or distressed content

### 2. Response Generation
Using **Google's FLAN-T5** model, EchoMind generates responses that:
- Match your emotional state
- Provide supportive and helpful content
- Ask engaging follow-up questions
- Maintain conversational flow

### 3. Tone Adjustment
If the initial response doesn't feel right, you can:
- Select a different emotional tone
- Regenerate the response instantly
- Compare different approaches

##  Usage

1. **Share Your Thoughts**: Type anything you're feeling or thinking about
2. **Customize Settings**: 
   - Adjust response length (40-150 words)
   - Control creativity level (0.0-1.5)
3. **Generate Response**: Click "Generate" to get an empathetic reply
4. **Fine-tune**: Use the tone correction feature if needed

### Example Interactions

**Input**: "I'm feeling overwhelmed with work lately"
- **Detected Sentiment**: Negative
- **Response**: *An empathetic paragraph acknowledging stress and offering support*

**Input**: "Just got a promotion at work!"
- **Detected Sentiment**: Positive  
- **Response**: *A celebratory and encouraging response*

##  Technical Details

### Models Used
- **Sentiment Analysis**: `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest`
- **Text Generation**: `google/flan-t5-base`
- **Language Detection**: `langdetect` library

### Hardware Support
- **GPU**: Automatically detects and uses CUDA if available
- **CPU**: Falls back to CPU processing for compatibility

### Performance Features
- **Caching**: Models are cached using `@st.cache_resource` for faster subsequent runs
- **Optimized Generation**: Uses repetition penalties for higher quality output
- **Memory Efficient**: Truncates long inputs to prevent memory issues

##  Configuration

### Model Settings
You can modify the models in the `get_pipelines()` function:

```python
# For different sentiment analysis models
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline(
    "sentiment-analysis", 
    model="your-preferred-model",
    device=DEVICE
)

# For different text generation models
text_generator = pipeline(
    "text2text-generation", 
    model="your-preferred-model",
    device=DEVICE
)
```

### UI Customization
Modify the Streamlit interface in the UI section:
- Change sliders ranges
- Adjust text areas
- Customize page layout
